Description
-----------

cparamlib is a simple library for calculation of fluxes for stable secondary particles
created in proton-proton interactions in astronomical environment according to the model
described in 
  Tuneyoshi Kamae, Niklas Karlsson, Tsunefumi Mizuno, Toshinori Abe, and Tatsumi Koi; 
  "Parameterization of $\gamma$, $e^{\pm}$ and Neutrino Spectra Produced by $p-p$ Interaction in Astronomical Environment"
to appear in Astrophysical Journal (2006) and
  Niklas Karlsson and Tuneyoshi Kamae;
  "Parameterization of the Angular Distribution of Gamma Rays Produced by P-P Interaction in Astronomical Environment"
to by submitted to Astrophysical Journal (2007).

IMPORTANT! The maintainer cannot be held responsible for anything that is caused by using
this library or its extension.

Requirements
------------

To build this library and the python wrapper one needs a working compiler, such as gcc, and must
have SWIG installed. SWIG is used to build the python wrapper code.

Build
-----

The library is now built using the autoconf/automake method:

./configure
make
make install

The user will most probably want to do
./configure --prefix=/your/path
to put the library in a non-standard path.

By default, the Python interface is not built. To build it, one would use
./configure --enable-python
This will compile the code and when issuing "make install", the Python package will be put
in ${prefix}/lib/pythonN.N/site-packages.

On 64-bit systems the library directory might be ${prefix}/lib64 rather than ${prefix}/lib. To make
sure the library is installed in the correct directory, pass the --libdir=${prefix}/lib64 option to
./configure. For example
./configure --prefix=/your/path --libdir=/your/path/lib64 --enable-pythonbuild

Using the library
-----------------

There is one example program, params.c, that uses the library to calculate inclusive cross sections
for non-diffractive, diffractive, Delta1232 and Reson1600 processes and for all secondary particles.

Generally, the library is linked to your program using something like

gcc yourprogram.c -L/usr/lib -lm -lcparamlib -o yourprogram.bin

In the directory examples/ you will find two example programs that builds with the library and an
example Makefile. This Makefile must be modified so that the two lines

  INCLUDE_DIR = /usr/include
  LIB_DIR = /usr/lib

points to the location where you installed the library (--prefix option with ./configure). The
default is /usr/include and /usr/lib. Also, do not forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you install
the library somewhere else than /usr/lib.

We have chosen not to build these example binaries with autoconf for two reasons:

  1) This way a normal user can use the Makefile as a template
  2) This does not clutter /usr/bin with unwanted binaries

In Python you import the cparamlib package, like this

import cparamlib

Subroutines
-----------

The subroutines in the libraryare used to calculate parameters and inclusive cross sections
according to tables 3 through 9.

Parameter calculation:

Step one is to calculate the parameter arrays a,b,c and d given in tables 3
through 9. Do this by calling the four functions for each of the secondary
particle species. Suffices for the functions are:
  nd		 contribution from non-diffractive process 
  diff	 contribution from diffractive process 
	nr		 sum of non-diffractive and diffraction 
  delta	 contribution from Delta(1232) excitation process 
  res		 contribution from res(1600) excitation process
				 (note that res(1600) represents a collaction of resonances) 

Arguments:
  Tp			proton kinetic energy in GeV
  params  pointer to a struct PARAMSET or a struct PARAMSET_PT where parameter 
					arrays are stored

Secondary particle id's:

The library uses the following id's for secondary particle species
ID_GAMMA				0
ID_ELECTRON			1
ID_POSITRON			2
ID_NUE					3
ID_NUMU					4
ID_ANTINUE			5
ID_ANTINUMU			6
which are all defined in the header file.

Inclusive cross sections:

Inclusive cross sections in mb are calculated separately for the four contributions
(non-diff, diff, delta and res). Note that that delta does not contribute to electrons
or electrons anti-neutrinos in the present modeling.

Arguments:
  particle  id of the secondary particle to calculate for
						(see list above)
  E					energy of the secondary particle in GeV
  Tp				proton kinetic energy in GeV
  params		pointer to a struct PARAMSET where parameter arrays are stored

Individual contributions are calculated with:
  double sigma_incl_nd(int particle, double E, double Tp, PARAMSET* params);
  double sigma_incl_diff(int particle, double E, double Tp, PARAMSET* params);
  double sigma_incl_delta(int particle, double E, double Tp, PARAMSET* params);
  double sigma_incl_res(int particle, double E, double Tp, PARAMSET* params);

Total inclusive cross sections is calculated with:
  double sigma_incl_tot(int particle, double E, double Tp);

pT Distributions:

pT distributions, i.e. differential cross section dsigma^2/dlogEdpT, are calculated for
gamma rays only.

Arguments:
  particle  id of the secondary particle to calculate for
						(see list above)
	pT				transverse momentum of particle in GeV/c
  E					energy of the secondary particle in GeV
  Tp				proton kinetic energy in GeV

  double sigma_pp_res(double Pp);

Test program
------------

A test program "test.c" shows how subroutines in the library lcparamlib can be used. 

To run the program, make sure that two executables "params" and "test" are made by
the "make all" command you have executed. In the directory where the two executables
are, execute "params" to create the parameters,
  > ./params 
You will then find 28 files with extension .dat in the directory.

Then execute "test" as,
  > ./test
  
A data file gammaspectrum.csv contains the E*dSigma(E)/dlog(E) of the gamma-ray
spectrum produced by continuum protons with power-law-index of 2 from the pion
threshold to Tp=512TeV. The first column of gammaspectrum.csv is log10 of gamma-ray
energy at log(E)=0.05 steps and the log(E*dSigma/dlogE) is log10 of E*dSigma(E)/dlog(E)
for each bin. Here E is in GeV and Sigma is the inclusive pp-gamma production
cross section in mb.  

You can change the program "test.c" to calculate secondary particle spectra produce
by any incident proton spectrum. You are reminded to "make clean" and "make all"
to create a new executable.
