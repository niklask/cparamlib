Description
-----------

cparamlib is a simple library for calculation of fluxes for stable secondary particles
created in proton-proton interactions in astronomical environment according to the model
described in 
  Tuneyoshi Kamae, Niklas Karlsson, Tsunefumi Mizuno, Toshinori Abe, and Tatsumi Koi; 
  "Parameterization of $\gamma$, $e^{\pm}$ and Neutrino Spectra Produced by $p-p$ Interaction in Astronomical Environment"
to appear in Astrophysical Journal (2006).

Feel free to include the source code within your own program.

IMPORTANT! The maintainer cannot be held responsible for anything that is caused by using
this piece of code.

Build
-----

The library is built by running "make all". The makefile is really simple and should be
self-explaining. Once the library is built, copy it to any location where you want to keep it.
The makefile also compiles the SWIG wrapper for interfacing the c library in python. For this to work one must
set the correct paths, i.e. change variables SWIG and PYTHON_INCLUDE.

Using the library
-----------------

There is one example program, params.c, that uses the library to calculate inclusive cross-sections
for non-diffractive, diffractive, Delta1232 and Reson1600 processes and for all secondary particles.

Generally, the library is linked to your program using something like

gcc yourprogram.c -L. -lm -lcparammodel -o yourprogram.bin

For use with python:
1. Build the library and python wrapper
2. Copy the python directory contents to somewhere where python will find it, for example site-packages.

Subroutines
-----------

The subroutines in the library libcparammodel.a are used to calculate parameters and inclusive
cross-sections according to tables 3 through 9.

Parameter calculation:

Step one is to calculate the parameter arrays a,b,c and d given in tables 3
through 9. Do this by calling the four functions for each of the secondary
particle species. Suffices for the functions are:
  nd		 contribution from non-diffractive process 
  diff	 contribution from diffractive process 
  delta	 contribution from Delta(1232) excitation process 
  res		 contribution from Res(1600) excitation process
				 (note that Res(1600) represents a collaction of resonances) 

Arguments:
  Tp			proton kinetic energy in GeV
  a,b,c,d pointer to where the parameter array will be stored
					dimensions are a[9], b[8], c[5], d[5]

Gamma-rays (table 3):
  void gamma_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void gamma_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void gamma_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void gamma_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Electrons (table 4):
  void elec_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void elec_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void elec_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void elec_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Positrons (table 5):
  void posi_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void posi_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void posi_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void posi_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Electron neutrinos (table 6):
	void nue_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void nue_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void nue_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void nue_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Electron anti-neutrinos (table 7):
  void antinue_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void antinue_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void antinue_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void antinue_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Muon neutrinos (table 8):
  void numu_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void numu_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void numu_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void numu_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Muon neutrinos (table 8):
  void antinumu_param_nd(double Tp, double* a);
  void antinumu_param_diff(double Tp, double* b);
  void antinumu_param_delta(double Tp, double* c);
  void antinumu_param_res(double Tp, double* d);

Secondary particle id's:

The library uses the following id's for secondary particle species
ID_GAMMA				0
ID_ELECTRON			1
ID_POSITRON			2
ID_NUE					3
ID_NUMU					4
ID_ANTINUE			5
ID_ANTINUMU			6

Inclusive cross-sections:

Inclusive cross-sections in mb are calculated separately for the four contributions
(non-diff, diff, delta and res). Note that that delta does not contribute to electrons
or electrons anti-neutrinos in the present modeling.

Arguments:
  particle  id of the secondary particle to calculate for
						(see list above)
  E					energy of the secondary particle in GeV
  Tp				proton kinetic energy in GeV
  a,b,c,d		parameter array for each species
						(note that these depend on the particle species)

Individual contributions are calculated with:
  double sigma_nd(int particle, double E, double Tp, double* a);
  double sigma_diff(int particle, double E, double Tp, double* b);
  double sigma_delta(int particle, double E, double Tp, double* c);
  double sigma_res(int particle, double E, double Tp, double* d);

Total inclusive cross-sections is calculated with:
  double sigma(int particle, double E, double Tp);

Test program
------------

A test program "test.c" shows how subroutines in the library lcparammodel can be used. 

To run the program, make sure that two executables "params" and "test" are made by
the "make all" command you have executed. In the directory where the two executables
are, execute "params" to create the parameters,
  > ./params 
You will then find 28 files with extension .dat in the directory.

Then execute "test" as,
  > ./test
  
A data file gammaspectrum.csv contains the E*dSigma(E)/dlog(E) of the gamma-ray
spectrum produced by continuum protons with power-law-index of 2 from the pion
threshold to Tp=512TeV. The first column of gammaspectrum.csv is log10 of gamma-ray
energy at log(E)=0.05 steps and the log(E*dSigma/dlogE) is log10 of E*dSigma(E)/dlog(E)
for each bin. Here E is in GeV and Sigma is the inclusive pp-gamma production
cross-section in mb.  

You can change the program "test.c" to calculate secondary particle spectra produce
by any incident proton spectrum. You are reminded to "make clean" and "make all"
to create a new executable.
