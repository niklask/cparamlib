cparamlib
==================
Niklas Karlsson <niklas@slac.stanford.edu> (maintainer)

cparamlib is a simple library for calculation of fluxes for stable secondary 
particles created in proton-proton interactions in astronomical environment.
according to the model described in 
Tuneyoshi Kamae, Niklas Karlsson, Tsunefumi Mizuno, Toshinori Abe,
and Tatsumi Koi; "Parameterization of $\gamma$, $e^{\pm}$ and 
Neutrino Spectra Produced by $p-p$ Interaction in Astronomical 
Environment" to appear in Astrophysical Journal (2006).

Feel free to include the source code within your own program.

IMPORTANT! The maintainer cannot be held responsible for anything that is
caused by using this piece of code.

BUILD
=====

The library is built by running "make all". The makefile is really simple
and should be self-explaining. Once the library is built, copy it to any
location where you want to keep it.

USING
=====

There is one example program, params.c, that uses the library to calculate
fluxes. It is compiled by the makefile.

Generally, the library is linked to your program using something like

gcc yourprogram.c -L. -lm -lcparammodel -o yourprogram.bin
